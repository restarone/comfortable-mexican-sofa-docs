## Overview

ComfortableMexicanSofa comes with revision history for Layouts, Pages and
Snippets. If you updated the any of those a Revision will be created. Then you
can revert to a previous version. If you want to control how many revisions are
being stored feel free to modify this setting found in the initializer:

    config.revisions_limit = 25

You may disable revision system completely by setting it to 0
