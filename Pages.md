Pages are exactly what you think they are: pages. Page is defined by a _slug_ and its relationship to the parent page. So a page with slug `overview` and parent that has _slug_ `help` will have full path `/help/overview`

Content of the page is controlled by a Layout. If you have multiple layouts selecting one from the select dropdown will refresh form with fields that are available for content population.

Pages have a simple publishing control. Checkbox controls if a given pages is visible to the public, or it's still a draft.
